# 🛠️ Questerix Workflow Guide

The Questerix project uses a consolidated **Unified Lifecycle** to ensure high-velocity, high-quality autonomous development.

## 🚀 Primary Command

### `/process` - Unified Development Lifecycle
**Use this for 99% of tasks.** It guides you through:
1.  **Planning** (Interactive Strategy, No Coding)
2.  **Implementation** (Recursive Fix Loop)
3.  **Testing** (Automation QA Loop)
4.  **Finalization** (Learning, Docs, Git Push)
5.  **Deployment** (Optional User-Triggered Release)

## 🛠️ Utility Workflows

### `/certify` - Independent Quality Audit
Run this AFTER `/process` completes to verify everything with fresh eyes. Acts as an independent inspector that re-checks database, code quality, security, tests, performance, and UX. Produces a certification report.

### `/autopilot` - Full Autonomous Execution
Enables the AI to run commands and solve complex multi-step problems without constant prompting.

### `/blocked` - Blockers & Partial Progress
Use this to report what is stopping you and what has been achieved so far.

### `/resume` - Multi-Session Continuity
Used when starting a new session to reload context from `TASK_STATE.json` and previous logs.

### `/help` - Show this guide
List available workflows and their purposes.

## 📜 Execution Philosophy

- **Plan First**: We never write code until we agree on the "Perfect Plan."
- **Evidence Contract**: Every implementation must provide proof of correctness.
- **Lean Docs**: Documentation must be reproducible and concise.
- **Recursive Fix**: We find and fix our own hallucinations before the User does.
