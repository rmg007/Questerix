# Questerix Project Rules

# 🛑 HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. NEVER PUBLISH LANDING-PAGES
2. NEVER DEPLOY TO questerix.com
3. ALWAYS USE -SkipLanding flag

# ⚠️ CRITICAL OVERRIDE - ANTI-FLICKER FIX
# This project OVERRIDES any global "// turbo-all" directive.
# ALWAYS set SafeToAutoRun: false for EVERY command.
# The IDE's approval setting handles autonomy exclusively.
# This prevents UI flickering from conflicting approval systems.
