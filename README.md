## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the complete **Executive Specification** for **Questerix** - an offline-first educational platform. It is designed to be consumed by AI Coding Agents (Cursor, Antigravity, etc.) to autonomously build the application.

The project consists of:
1.  **Student App** (`student-app/`): A Flutter tablet app (offline-first, Drift DB).
2.  **Admin Panel** (`admin-panel/`): A React dashboard (shadcn/ui, Supabase Auth).
3.  **Landing Pages** (`landing-pages/`): Marketing site (React/Vite, Tailwind CSS).
4.  **Domain Models** (`questerix_domain/`): Shared Dart models and validators.
5.  **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions, Realtime).

## 📂 Key Files

- **`AI_CODING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**: Short-form, code-grounded AI instructions (contracts, authority order, non-negotiables).
- **`ROADMAP.md`**: The visual timeline of the project phases.
- **`PHASE_STATE.json`**: The state file tracking the agent's progress.
- **`docs/specs/*`**: Detailed blueprints for UI, Data, and API.
- **`.mcp_config.json`**: Ready-to-use MCP server configuration.

## 🤖 For AI Agents

1.  **Read `docs/strategy/AGENTS.md`** immediately.
2.  **Check `PHASE_STATE.json`** to see where to begin.
3.  **Execute** the current phase strictly according to the specs.
4.  **Validate** using the provided scripts (e.g., `scripts/validate-phase-0.ps1`).

**Do not deviate from the specifications.**

### 🦾 Agent Commands
- **`/autopilot`**: Triggers full autonomous build & maintenance capability.
- **`/test`**: Runs the recommended "Enterprise QA" suite (Offline-Sync integration, E2E, Lint).
*See `docs/technical/DEVELOPMENT.md` for full command details.*
