## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the complete **Executive Specification** for an offline-first educational platform. It is designed to be consumed by AI Coding Agents (Cursor, Antigravity, etc.) to autonomously build the application.

The project consists of:
1.  **Student App**: A Flutter tablet app (offline-first, Drift DB).
2.  **Admin Panel**: A React dashboard (shadcn/ui, Supabase Auth).
3.  **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions, Realtime).

## 📂 Key Files

- **`AGENTS.md`**: The Supreme Law. The execution protocol every agent must follow.
- **`ROADMAP.md`**: The visual timeline of the project phases.
- **`PHASE_STATE.json`**: The state file tracking the agent's progress.
- **`AppShell/docs/specs/*`**: Detailed blueprints for UI, Data, and API.

## 🤖 For AI Agents

1.  **Read `AGENTS.md`** immediately.
2.  **Check `PHASE_STATE.json`** to see where to begin.
3.  **Execute** the current phase strictly according to the specs.
4.  **Validate** using the provided scripts (e.g., `scripts/validate-phase-0.ps1`).

**Do not deviate from the specifications.**
