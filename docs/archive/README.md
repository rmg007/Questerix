# Archived Documentation

This folder contains stale documentation that was archived on 2026-02-03 as part of the "Lean Docs" initiative.

## Why These Were Archived

These files were session artifacts or one-time documents, not living documentation:

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md` | Session artifact |
| `PHASE_2_PROGRESS.md` | Session artifact |
| `HIGH_PRIORITY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Session artifact |
| `HIGH_PRIORITY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | Session artifact |
| `REMAINING_TASKS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | Session artifact |
| `WORK_SESSION_COMPLETE.md` | Session artifact |
| `PROJECT_STATUS.md` | Replaced by PHASE_STATE.json |
| `MCP_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` | One-time setup confirmation |
| `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` | One-time migration |

## Retrieval

If you need information from these files, they are still here. Just don't maintain them.

## Single Source of Truth

Living documentation is now in:

| Purpose | Location |
|---------|----------|
| Agent Contract | `AGENTS.md` |
| How to Run | `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` |
| Deployment | `docs/DEPLOYMENT_PIPELINE.md` |
| CI Contract | `docs/CI_CONTRACT.md` |
| AI Instructions | `AI_CODING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` |
| Workflows | `.agent/workflows/*.md` |
